# Advance Data Analysis (SQL) 


*This project is a follow-up to my [Data Warehouse Project (Data Engineering)](https://github.com/syedshamael1999/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project/tree/main), where I built a data warehouse using SQL Server, following Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold). The clean, business-ready data in the Gold Layer serves as the foundation for this exploratory data analysis.*
